Basic idea:
This project is a simple e-commerce website. I've created an API featuring anime characters and cool electronics.
We have only 2 categories (one piece anime characters and electronics). You can see brands like Apple, Tesla and SpaceX in electronics. We can filter/sort the products by its brand and price. We can add products to cart , the cart products are stored in redux store.

I've tested most important features(redux dispatch functions, fetching data etc) using Jest, React Testing Library and MSW.
